# Movie Recommendation | Python | PyScript | Javascript | HTML | CSS | IMDB Database

This project demonstrates how to create your own movie recommendation website using **PyScript**. PyScript emables you to run Python in browser. This is a game changer for those who want to host sites but are not prepared for the expenditure. I have analyzed and prepared a dataset suitable for movie recommendation using SVD algorithm. This is a popular approach for user-item type datasets, as it handles sparcity and reduces dimensionality.  

## Features
- Fully client-side implementation using PyScript and Pyodide.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages, ensuring easy accessibility and no backend server requirements.

## Personal Note

I want to take a moment to share something personal and meaningful to me. 

This project holds a special place in my heart. Unlike much of my education, which was very rigid and lacking in color - this project began as a self-learning journey devoid of grades and judgements. A few days ago I revisited this project. It was laughably barren, but hey, this was an initiative taken by me to learn something new. I was recently looking for a solution to be able to host a website despite using dynamic logic, without having to pay for services. I decided to use this project as my guinea pig, and now it does not look so barren anymore!

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you enjoy exploring this project as much as I enjoyed creating it.
